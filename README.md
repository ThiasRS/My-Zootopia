# 🐾 Animal Repository Generator

A Python-based tool that fetches data from the [API-Ninjas Animals API](https://api-ninjas.com/api/animals) and generates a stylish, dynamic website (`animals.html`) based on user input.

## 🚀 Features

* **Real-time Data:** Fetches up-to-date animal characteristics (diet, location, type).
* **Dynamic HTML Generation:** Converts JSON data into clean, CSS-styled HTML cards.
* **Robust Error Handling:** Displays a centered notification on the website if no animal matches the search term.
* **Security First:** Uses environment variables (`.env`) to keep your API key secure and out of the source code.
